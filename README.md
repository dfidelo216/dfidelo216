- 👋 Hi, I’m Jamie!
- 👀 I’m interested in neocities sites! It's actually what spurred me into learning coding as a hobby and potentially for career advancement :) Here's mine! https://dawnfire.neocities.org/
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and SQL! A bit of CSS/HTML as well, but mostly Python right now (I am a beginner and taking a course on Coursera to get a professional cert for Data Science stuff)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything neocities related~! I'm still a novice but I do have a math background from college so sometimes that helps?
- 📫 How to reach me: through discord at jameme#7801
